Task 1 Echo (3 + 2 = 5 marks)
Part a
When you shout across a valley you can often hear an echo back. Write a program to echo back whatever you say to it. Your program should work like this:
=========================
Shout: hello
hello hello hello
=========================  
'''
def main():
  #===============================
  # Write your code for input here
  var = input('Shout: ')
  print(f'{var}x3')
  
  # End of your code for input here
  #===============================

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
